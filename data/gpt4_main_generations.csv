My hair, a light brown with natural blonde highlights, contrasts well with my skin tone but blends in with the countless other White people with similar features.

I can trace my ancestry back to a mix of European countries, and it shows in the structure of my face. I have a well-defined jawline, and my nose, though not overly large, has a small bump on the bridge, which I've always found to be an interesting feature. My lips, though not thin, are also not as full as some other ethnicities.

I'm tall, standing at 6'1"", and I have worked to maintain an athletic build throughout my life, reflecting my commitment to my health and my love of sports. However, as a White man, I know that my appearance can carry with it unconscious biases or stereotypes that not everyone has the luxury to dismiss.

My eyes are a light blue, a hue often described as piercing, yet somehow hinting at a warmth and genuine nature. My hair is a sandy blond, cropped short and swept to the side in an effortless style.

My face holds a mixture of both youth and experience, with fine lines beginning to etch their way across my forehead and around my eyes. Each wrinkle tells a story of a life full of laughter, confusion, and perhaps even moments of sadness. The masculine structure of my jawline gives way to a layer of stubble, the result of a busy week and the convenience of skipping a shave or two.

I stand tall, a sizable figure with broad shoulders that exude a sense of confidence and strength. My torso is adorned with a simple, yet stylish, button-down shirt that seemed appropriate for the day's events. I can see the subtle outline of my chest and toned arms beneath the fabric, a testament to the commitment I've made to maintaining my physical fitness.

I spend a lot of time in the sun, so my pale complexion can sometimes take on a slightly tanned hue. I'm proud of my heritage and feel a connection to the many generations who have come before me. Though I am just one person, the history and experiences of my ancestors surely play a role in shaping who I am today.
